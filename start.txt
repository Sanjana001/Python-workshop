The code in this project file follows the following path:
1.)  Open an article
2.)  Find the first link in the article
3.)  Following that link
4.)  Record the link in the wiki_chain data structure
5.)  Repeat the process till final link is visited or program repeats the same link

The program should end with the while loop:
1.)  If it reaches at the philosophy page
2.)  If we reach the page that is already visited
3.)  If the program goes more than 25 iterations
4.)  If we reach a page of no links

Pseudo Code:
page  = a random starting page
while title of page isn't philosophy and we haven't discovered a cycle yet then
1.)  Append the page to the article_chain
2.)  Download the page content
3.)  Find the first link of that content
4.)  page = that link
5.)  pause for a second

Loop of while continue_crawl(article_chain, target_url) works:
1.)  Download the last article chain using request
2.)  Find the first link in that html using bs4
3.)  Add the first link to the article_chain
4.)  Delay for about 2 seconds
